# Quixote API: `QElement`

* [Back to overview README](../README.md)
* [Back to API overview](api.md)

`QElement` instances represent individual HTML elements. You'll use their properties to make assertions about your elements. For properties that don't exist yet, use [`element.getRawStyle()`](#elementgetrawstyle).


## Properties

Use these properties to make assertions about the element.

**Compatibility Note:** We make every effort to ensure that properties work identically across browsers. If you discover a cross-browser incompatibility that doesn't correspond to an actual, visible difference, please file an issue.

**Pixel Rounding Note:** Browsers handle pixel rounding in different ways. We consider pixel values to be the same if they're within 0.5px of each other. If you have rounding errors that are *greater* than 0.5px, make sure your test browsers are set to a zoom level of 100%. Zooming can exaggerate rounding errors.


### Positions and Sizes

```
Stability: 3 - Stable
```

These properties include padding and borders (if any), but not margins. They can also be "not rendered" if the element has the `display: none` property or if the element isn't in the DOM. (For more exact rendering assertions, use the [element rendering properties](#element-rendering) below.)

* `element.top (`[`PositionDescriptor`](PositionDescriptor.md)`)` The top edge of the element.
* `element.right (`[`PositionDescriptor`](PositionDescriptor.md)`)` The right edge of the element.
* `element.bottom (`[`PositionDescriptor`](PositionDescriptor.md)`)` The bottom edge of the element.
* `element.left (`[`PositionDescriptor`](PositionDescriptor.md)`)` The left edge of the element.
* `element.center (`[`PositionDescriptor`](PositionDescriptor.md)`)` Horizontal center: midway between right and left.
* `element.middle (`[`PositionDescriptor`](PositionDescriptor.md)`)` Vertical middle: midway between the top and bottom.
* `element.width (`[`SizeDescriptor`](SizeDescriptor.md)`)` Width of the element.
* `element.height (`[`SizeDescriptor`](SizeDescriptor.md)`)` Height of the element.

Example:

```javascript
logo.height.should.equal(10);           // The logo height should equal 10 pixels.
logo.left.should.equal(navbar.height);  // The logo's left edge should be the same as the navbar's left edge.
```


### Element Rendering

```
Stability: 3 - Stable
```

This property describes whether an element is rendered. It can include padding and borders, but it never includes margins. We check these things about the element:

* Whether it's part of the DOM (elements that have been removed from the DOM aren't rendered)
* Its width and height (elements with no width or height aren't rendered)
* Its position on the page (things you can scroll to are rendered, but things hidden off the top or left of the page aren't)
* The `display` property
* The `clip` property
* The `overflow` property

Note that an element can be rendered, but still be invisible to the userâ€”for example, if it's composed entirely of transparent pixels, or if the `visibility: hidden` property is set, or some other reason.

* `element.render (`[`ElementRender`](ElementRender.md)`)` Whether any part of the element is rendered.
* `element.render.top (`[`PositionDescriptor`](PositionDescriptor.md)`)` Top edge of the rendered part of the element.
* `element.render.right (`[`PositionDescriptor`](PositionDescriptor.md)`)` Right edge of the rendered part of the element.
* `element.render.bottom (`[`PositionDescriptor`](PositionDescriptor.md)`)` Bottom edge of the rendered part of the element.
* `element.render.left (`[`PositionDescriptor`](PositionDescriptor.md)`)` Left edge of the rendered part of the element.
* `element.render.center (`[`PositionDescriptor`](PositionDescriptor.md)`)` Horizontal center: midway between right and left.
* `element.render.middle (`[`PositionDescriptor`](PositionDescriptor.md)`)` Vertical middle: midway between the top and bottom.
* `element.render.width (`[`SizeDescriptor`](SizeDescriptor.md)`)` Width of the rendered part of the element.
* `element.render.height (`[`SizeDescriptor`](SizeDescriptor.md)`)` Height of the rendered part of the element.

Example: "The caption doesn't break out of the bottom of the content area."

```javascript
caption.render.bottom.should.equal(content.bottom);
```

**Compatibility Notes:**

* We don't support the `clip-path` property at this time. It's so complicated that full support is unlikely.

* We don't support the `overflow: clip` property at this time, but we might in the future. As of April 2020, `overflow: clip` is still experimental and no browsers support it.

* We don't support the `overflow: overlay` property and probably never will. It's deprecated.

* The `element.render` properties don't work on IE 8. This is due to bugs in IE 8's reporting of the `clip` property. You can check for IE 8's broken behavior with the [`quixote.browser.misreportsClipAutoProperty()`](quixote.md#quixotebrowser) browser detect.

* Some browsers, such as IE 11 and Chrome Mobile 44, misreport the value of the `clip` property under certain circumstances. This could cause the `element.render` properties to throw an error. You can check for this broken behavior with the [`quixote.browser.misreportsAutoValuesInClipProperty()`](quixote.md#quixotebrowser) browser detect.


## Methods

### element.getRawStyle()

```
Stability: 3 - Stable
```

Determine how the browser is actually rendering an element's style. This uses [`getComputedStyle()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window.getComputedStyle) under the covers. (On IE 8, it uses [`currentStyle`](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/ms535231%28v=vs.85%29.aspx)).

`style = element.getRawStyle(property)`

* `style (string)` The browser's computed style, or an empty string if the style wasn't recognized.
 
* `property (string)` The name of the property to retrieve. Should always be written in kebab-case, even on IE 8.

Example: `var fontSize = element.getRawStyle("font-size");`

**Compatibility Note:** `getRawStyle` does *not* attempt to resolve cross-browser differences, with two exceptions:

* IE 8 uses `currentStyle` rather than `getComputedStyle()`, and kebab-case property names are converted to camelCase to match currentStyle's expectation.
* Different browsers return `null`, `undefined`, or `""` when a property can't be found. Quixote always returns `""`. 

**Compatibility Note:** When using `getRawStyle("font-size")`, be aware that Mobile Safari may increase the size of small fonts. (You can prevent this behavior by using `-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;` in your CSS.) You can detect this behavior by using [`quixote.browser.enlargesFonts()`](quixote.md#quixotebrowser).


### element.getRawPosition()

```
Stability: 3 - Stable
```

Determine where an element is displayed within the frame viewport, as computed by the browser. This uses [`getBoundingClientRect()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element.getBoundingClientRect) under the covers. Note that scrolling the document will cause the position to change. You can use [`QFrame.getRawScrollPosition()`](QFrame.md#framegetrawscrollposition) to compensate for the effect of scrolling.

`position = element.getRawPosition()`

* `position (object)` The position of the element relative to the top-left corner of the viewport. In other words, if you scroll the document down 10 pixels, `top` will be 10 pixels larger. All values include border and padding, but not margin.
  * `top (number)` top edge
  * `right (number)` right edge
  * `bottom (number)` bottom edge
  * `left (number)` left edge
  * `width (number)` width (right edge minus left edge)
  * `height (number)` height (bottom edge minus top edge)

Example: `var top = element.getRawPosition().top;`

**Compatibility Note:** `getRawPosition()` does *not* attempt to resolve cross-browser differences, with one exception:

* IE 8's `getBoundingClientRect()` does not have `width` or `height` properties, but `getRawPosition()` calculates them from the other properties.


### element.calculatePixelValue()

```
Stability: 3 - Stable
```

Convert a CSS length string, such as `12em`, to the corresponding number of pixels. The calculation is provided by the browser and takes into account all styles currently in effect on the element.

`pixels = element.calculatePixelValue(length)`

* `pixels (number)` The number of pixels in the length.

* `length (string)` A [CSS length string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/length). Negative values are supported.

**Compatibility Note:** IE 8 and IE 11 round the `pixels` result to the nearest integer value. You can detect this behavior by using [`quixote.browser.roundsOffPixelCalculations()`](quixote.md#quixotebrowser).


### element.add()

```
Stability: 3 - Stable
```

Create an element and append it as a child of this element. Throws an exception unless exactly one element is created. (But that one element may contain children.)

`child = element.add(html, nickname)`

* `child (QElement)` The element you created.

* `html (string)` HTML for your element.

* `nickname (optional string)` The name to use when describing your element in error messages. Defaults to the element ID, class names, or tag name, in that order.

Example: `var foo = element.add("<p>foo</p>", "foo");`


### element.remove()

```
Stability: 3 - Stable
```

Remove the element from the DOM.

`element.remove()`


### element.parent()

```
Stability: 3 - Stable
```

Get the element's parent element.

`parent = element.parent(nickname)`

* `parent (QElement or null)` The parent element. Null if this element is the frame's body element or if this element has been removed from the DOM.

* `nickname (optional string)` The name to use when describing your element in error messages. Defaults to the element ID, class names, or tag name, in that order.


### element.contains()

```
Stability: 3 - Stable
```

Determine if this element contains another element.

`isContained = element.contains(otherElement)`

* `isContained (boolean)` True if `element` is an ancestor of `otherElement` or if they are the same element. False otherwise.

* `otherElement (QElement)` The possible child element to check.


### element.toDomElement()

```
Stability: 3 - Stable
```

Retrieve the underlying [`HTMLElement`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement) DOM element for the frame.
 
`dom = element.toDomElement()`

* `dom (`[`HTMLElement`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement)`)` The DOM element.


## Deprecated Methods

### element.assert()

```
Stability: 0 - Deprecated
```

**Deprecation Warning:** This method may be removed in a future release. Use [QElement properties'](#properties) `should` assertions instead.

Check whether the element's properties match a set of expected values. If they match, nothing happens; if they don't match, this method throws an exception explaining the difference.

`element.assert(expected, message)`

* `expected (object)` An object containing one or more [QElement properties](#properties) (`top`, `right`, etc.) as keys, along with the expected value as another property or a hard-coded value.

* `message (optional string)` A message to include when the assertion fails and an exception is thrown.

Example:

```javascript
element.assert({
  top: 13,                   // compare to a hard-coded value
  bottom: otherElement.top   // compare to another descriptor
});
```


### element.diff()

```
Stability: 0 - Deprecated
```

**Deprecation Warning:** This method may be removed in a future release. Use [QElement properties'](#properties) `should` assertions instead.

Compare the element's properties to a set of expected values. This is the same as [`QElement.assert()`](#elementassert), except that it returns a string rather than throwing an exception.

`diff = element.diff(expected)`

* `diff (string)` A human-readable description of any differences found, or an empty string if none.

* `expected (object)` An object containing one or more [QElement properties](#properties) (`top`, `right`, etc.) as keys, along with the expected value as another property or hard-coded value.
